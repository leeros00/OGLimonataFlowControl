# Limonata
Limonata is an open-source platform for ChemE students, educators, and hobbyists to prototype their ideas with Arduino. 
Inspired by the elegant simplicity of the TCLab, Limonata seeks to bridge the barriers to entry for chemical engineering education, startups, and hobbyists alike. 
Currently it is in development and the name is subject to change; rather it is the first thing the author thought of.
